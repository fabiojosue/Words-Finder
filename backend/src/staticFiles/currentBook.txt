what

theo
rem
or

is
it
still

today
the
cap
theorem
o
r
also
known
as
the
brewer
theorem
claims
that
i
n
the
event
of
a
netw
ork
failure
on
a
database
it
is
possible
to
provide
either
consistency
o
r
availability
but
not
both

gets
in
deep
with
th
is
concept
“the
cap
theorem
is
compri
sed
of
three
components
as
they
relat
e
to
dat
a
stores
consistency
all
reads
receive
the
most
recent
w
rite
or
an
error
availability
all
reads
contain
data
but
it
might
not
be
the
most
recent
partition
tolerance
the
system
con
tinues
to
operate
network
failures
in
normal
operations
your
data
store
provides
all
three
functions
but
the
cap
theorem
maintains
that
when
a
distributed
database
e
xperiences
a
network
failure
you
can
provide
either
consistenc
y
or
ava
ilability
in
the
theore
m
partition
tolerance
is
a
must
networks
failures
will
hap
pen
so
to
offer
any
kind
of
reliable
service
partition
tolerance
is
nec
essary
when
a
networ
k
failure
happens
one
can
choose
to
guarantee
consistency
or
availability
the
choice
is
really
a
m
atter
of
philosophical
discussion
that
’s
rarely
made
in
practice
consistency
and
availability
comes
wit
h
choosing
which
databas
e
to
go
with
such
as
sql
and
nosql
consisten
t
databases
should
be
used
when
the
value
of
the
information
returned
need
to
be
accur
ate
for
e
xample
bank
account
balances
and
text
messages
and
you
can
use
databases
such
as
mongodb
redis
and
h
base
availability
databases
should
be
used
when
the
service
is
more
i
mportant
t
han
the
information
like
e
commerce
business
some
database
options
are
cassan
dra
dynamodb
cosmosdb
this
theorem
is
still
valid
because
nowadays
we
f
ace
a
lot
of
specific
problems
and
we
have
to
bring
the
best
solution
for
every
single
one
of
them
2
why
do
you
think
no
relational
databases
are
more
popular
now
than
ever
before
through
the
time
passes
no
relational
databases
are
more
popular
because
people
have
realized
that
there
is
a
better
optimal
software
made
for
specific
problems
and
situations
that
we
confront
every
day
for
example
there
is
no
need
to
use
a
relational
database
when
you
are
creating
a
shopping
cart
it
is
proved
that
it’s
better
to
work
with
a
key
value
database
for
this
specific
case
thus
no
relational
databases
are
more
flexible
th
an
relational
databases
and
are
more
friendly
to
developers

do
you
think
no
relational
databases
are
old
and
they
should
change
similar
to
nosql
explain
your
answer
relational
databases
are
old
but
not
useless
they
should
be
used
for
any
transactional
application
for
example
when
there
is
a
need
to
create
and
work
with
a
software
wh
ere
a
requirement
says
that
you
have
to
integrate
payment
methods
in
it
so
there
is
no
need
to
change
them
what
you
should
do
when
creating
a
new
project
is
sit
and
discuss
what
type
of
database
you
really
need
for
your
application
4
provide
an
example
of
how
we
could
use
these
types
of
dbs
key
/
value
documents
graphs
and
columns
for
key
value
databases
it
is
important
to
work
with
non
persistent
data
for
example
when
you
are
creating
a
shopping
cart
when
developing
an
e
commerce
you
should
use
document
databases
to
work
with
the
products
and
orders
schemas
there
is
a
lot
of
uses
for
graphs
databases
like
social
media
platforms
but
it
is
also
useful
for
recommendation
engines
family
column
databases
are
good
to
work
with
blogging
platforms
